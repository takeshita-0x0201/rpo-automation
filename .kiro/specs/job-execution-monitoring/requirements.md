# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to create a comprehensive job execution monitoring and debugging system for the recruitment automation platform. The system will provide real-time visibility into job execution status, detailed error tracking, and proactive alerting to prevent issues like the recent AI evaluation processing problems where jobs completed immediately without proper execution or error reporting.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor all job executions in real-time, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues before they impact the recruitment process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a job is started THEN the system SHALL record the job start time, type, and initial parameters
2. WHEN a job is executing THEN the system SHALL update the job status every 30 seconds with current progress
3. WHEN a job encounters an error THEN the system SHALL capture the full error details including stack trace and context
4. WHEN a job completes THEN the system SHALL record completion time, final status, and execution summary

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed error logs and debugging information, so that I can quickly diagnose and fix issues in the job execution pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs during job execution THEN the system SHALL log the error with timestamp, job context, and full stack trace
2. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL capture the SQL query, parameters, and database error details
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL log the request details, response status, and error message
4. IF a job fails THEN the system SHALL preserve all intermediate data for debugging purposes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a recruitment manager, I want to receive alerts when jobs fail or take longer than expected, so that I can take corrective action promptly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a job fails THEN the system SHALL send an immediate notification to designated administrators
2. WHEN a job exceeds expected execution time THEN the system SHALL send a warning notification
3. WHEN multiple jobs fail within a short timeframe THEN the system SHALL escalate the alert priority
4. WHEN system resources are running low THEN the system SHALL proactively alert before job failures occur

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a dashboard to view job execution history and performance metrics, so that I can optimize system performance and identify patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the monitoring dashboard THEN the system SHALL display current job status for all active jobs
2. WHEN viewing job history THEN the system SHALL show execution times, success rates, and error patterns
3. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on average execution time, resource usage, and throughput
4. WHEN filtering job data THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by date range, job type, status, and user

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated health checks for critical system components, so that potential issues are detected before they cause job failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL verify database connectivity and table structure integrity
2. WHEN scheduled health checks run THEN the system SHALL test API endpoints, database queries, and external service connections
3. WHEN a health check fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure and attempt automatic recovery if possible
4. WHEN critical components are unhealthy THEN the system SHALL prevent new jobs from starting until issues are resolved

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want job execution retry mechanisms with exponential backoff, so that temporary failures don't result in permanent job failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a job fails due to temporary issues THEN the system SHALL automatically retry with exponential backoff
2. WHEN retry attempts are made THEN the system SHALL log each attempt with delay duration and reason
3. WHEN maximum retry attempts are reached THEN the system SHALL mark the job as permanently failed
4. IF a job succeeds after retries THEN the system SHALL log the successful recovery and reset failure counters
